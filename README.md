# Room-shuffling
At Navgurukul, we used to shuffle room assignments every two months. In this process, we randomly assigned students to new rooms with new roommates. It was quite a headache for our team members to do this every time, so this project makes it much easier. We just have to click the shuffle button, and it randomly assigns students to different rooms.
